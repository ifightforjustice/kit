        Kira v0.0000...1.x

At some future date, Kira will be a programming language.  Right
now, it's a work in progress.  Use build_windows.bat or
build_linux.sh to build it, or just pass *.c to your C compiler.
Then I recommend running

   out --test

to see if the tests pass.

Here's the project timeline:

   1. Parsing.  (DONE)
   2. Typechecking/name-resolving.  (in progress)
   3. Generate code, i.e. have a working compiler.
   4. Cleanup error messages to have useful source information.
   5. Cleanup the language syntax to make it more usable.
   6. Make a self-hosted implementation (adding improvements and
      fixes to the C implementation when useful).
   7. ...

As of step 6, the language will be "C with templates and RAII,"
essentially.  Future versions of the language will be more
advanced.
