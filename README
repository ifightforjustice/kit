        Kira v0.0000...1.x

At some future date, Kira will be a programming language.  Right
now, it's a work in progress.  Use build_windows.bat or
build_linux.sh to build it, or just pass *.c to your C compiler.
Then I recommend running

   out --test

to see if the tests pass.

Then, try running,

   cd examples
   ..\out foo
   cl main.c foo.obj
   main

to see things actually working.

Here's the project timeline:

   1. Parsing.  (DONE)
   2. Typechecking/name-resolving.  (DONE)
   3. Generate code, i.e. have a working compiler.  (DONE)
   3a. Support interior lambda expressions.
   3b. Support the stdcall calling convention.
   4. Cleanup error messages to have useful source information.
   5. Cleanup the language syntax to make it more usable. (in progress)
   6. Make a self-hosted implementation (adding improvements and
      fixes to the C implementation when useful).
   7. ...

As of step 6, the language will be "C with templates and RAII,"
essentially.  Future versions of the language will be more
advanced.
