        Kira v0.0000...1.x

At some future date, Kira will be a programming language.  Right now,
it's a work in progress.  Use build_windows.bat or build_linux.sh to
build it, or just pass *.c to your C compiler.  Then I recommend
running

   out --test

to see if the tests pass.

Here's the project timeline:

   1. Make a parser.  (DONE)
   2. Get the code typechecked and validated.  (in progress)
   3. Generate code, i.e. have a working compiler.
   4. Cleanup error messages to have useful source information.
   5. Cleanup the language syntax to make it more usable.
   6. Make a self-hosted implementation, adding improvements and fixes
      to the C implementation as necessary.
